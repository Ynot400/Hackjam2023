This Repository was created for a 12 hour Hackathon event, in which our group members attempted to make a recipe maker by implempenting a sql database paired with a webscraping functionality. 
Unforunately, we did not have enough time or inital expertise to complete this task, but we gained valuable beginner knowledge on setting up an sql database, understanding the fundamentals of
server side javascript with node.js, and website parsing with cheerio.js.

Group members: Joshua-Luke Lacsamana, Caden Spokas, Patrick Aabram, Logan White
